Here are the basic Git commands:

git init - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git clone - Creates a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine.
git add - Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit.
git commit - Creates a new commit, recording the changes in the staging area.
git status - Shows the current state of the repository, including which files are modified, staged, and committed.
git log - Shows a list of all commits in the repository, in reverse chronological order.
git diff - Shows the difference between two versions of a file, such as the current working directory and the staging area, or two different commits.
git checkout - Switches to a different branch or commit.
git branch - Creates, lists, and deletes branches.
git merge - Combines the changes from two branches into a single branch.
git push - Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.
git pull - Downloads the latest commits from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository.
These are the most basic Git commands, and they should be enough to get you started with version control. There are many other Git commands, but you can learn them as you need them.

Here is a simple example of how to use some of these basic Git commands:

Create a new Git repository:
git init
Clone a remote Git repository:
git clone <url of remote repository>
Make some changes to a file in the repository:
vim myfile.txt
Add the changed file to the staging area:
git add myfile.txt
Commit the changes:
git commit -m "My commit message"
Push the local commits to the remote repository:
git push
This is just a basic example, but it should give you a good starting point for learning Git.
